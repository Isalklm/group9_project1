Exploratory Analysis of House Prices
1. Initial Data Exploration
•	The dataset contains 2,000 records of house prices, with features such as Number of Bedrooms, Number of bathrooms, Square Footage, location, condition, garage presence, and year built.
•	Data inspection revealed that there are no missing values in the dataset, which indicates that every house in the dataset specifies its location
2. Distribution of Houses According to there locations
     From calculating the count of each location in the dataset it was evident a greater number of the population lived in the downtown areas followed by urban, suburban and rural areas in that order
. a pie chart was used to give a pictorial representation of the distribution
3. Impact of location  on House Prices
.By calculating the mean price of each location it was observed  that the most expensive houses were in the suburban areas then Rural ,downtown and the least expensive in urban areas with a slight difference in price between all four groups
A bar chart was used to compare the means of the average prices
	The one-way ANOVA test for Locations showed that the p-value was 0.1943221,this shows that the difference between the prices has no statistically significance
4. Average House Price Over Time
	A line plot was used to show  that average prices fluctuate significantly over the years for all areas, with no clear or consistent trend of one category having consistently higher prices than the other. However, there may be some differences in the rate of increase or specific price ranges between the early period (1900-1921) and the later period (2000-2021).
 6. Outliers in House Prices
•	Outliers in house prices were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method:
	There were no outliers detected for all locatins
 9. Overall Observations
•	The analysis indicates that Location has a weak influence on house prices, as evidenced by comparing the average prices for all locations
•	This dataset does not reveal any major factors that lead to statistically significant variations in house prices, suggesting that other variables might play a more substantial role in determining house prices.
Conclusion
 	From the analysis location has no or a minimal effect on the price of houses in this dataset with zero outliers and  a p value of 0.19432 proves that any price different from the mean prices has no statistical correlation with the location .
